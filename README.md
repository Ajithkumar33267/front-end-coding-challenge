## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ajithkumar33267/front-end-coding-challenge.git
   cd front-end-coding-challenge
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
4. **Open in Browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Approach & Challenges
### Approach
- Used **React (Next.js)** for frontend.
- Implemented **ShadCN UI** for improved UI components.
- Used **PokeAPI** to fetch PokÃ©mon data.
- Implemented efficient **filtering, sorting, and pagination** for better performance.
- Used **Skeleton Loader** to improve UX during data fetching.

### Challenges & Trade-offs
- **Data Fetching Optimization:** Limited API requests to avoid performance issues.
- **Search Across Pagination:** Ensured search works across all PokÃ©mon, not just the currently fetched ones.
- **Multi-Select Filtering:** Enhanced filtering to support multiple PokÃ©mon types.
